A [TextMate](http://macromates.com) bundle for Markdown-based blogging on systems with little or no remote (XMLRPC) support. This was designed for [TUAW](http://www.tuaw.com), but is quite flexible and contains myriad commands to make any Markdown-based blogging system smoother.

Please see <http://bundle.weblogzinc.com/> for documentation (or something to that effect).
